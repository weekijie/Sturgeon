# CDC Clinical Guidance for Legionella Infections

## Key Principle

**Legionnaires' disease cannot be clinically or radiographically distinguished from pneumonia due to other pathogens.**

Appropriate testing must be performed to make the correct diagnosis and inform treatment decisions.

## When to Test for Legionella

### Indications for Legionnaires' Disease Testing

For patients with pneumonia, test for Legionella when ANY of the following are present:

1. **Outpatient antibiotic failure for community-acquired pneumonia**
   - Worsening or lack of improvement despite standard CAP antibiotics

2. **Severe pneumonia, particularly requiring intensive care**
   - ICU admission for respiratory failure
   - High oxygen requirements
   - Multi-organ dysfunction

3. **Immunocompromising condition**
   - Immunosuppressive therapy
   - HIV/AIDS
   - Malignancy
   - Organ transplant

4. **Travel during incubation period**
   - Overnight travel away from home
   - **High-risk settings:** Hotels, resorts, cruise ships
   - Incubation period: up to 14 days before symptom onset

5. **Healthcare-associated pneumonia**
   - Overnight stay in healthcare facility during incubation period
   - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (48+ hours after admission)

6. **Epidemiologic link to known Legionella source**
   - Association with laboratory-confirmed case
   - Facility with positive environmental tests
   - Recent changes in water quality

### Healthcare Facility Risk Assessment

**Test for healthcare-associated Legionnaires' disease if facility has:**
- Healthcare-associated Legionnaires' case in past year
- Positive environmental tests for Legionella
- Recent changes in water quality

## Diagnostic Testing

### Preferred Diagnostic Tests

**Use BOTH tests together:**

1. **Culture or molecular testing** of lower respiratory secretions
   - Detects full range of Legionella types
   - Specimens: Sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
   - Culture: Gold standard, allows antibiotic sensitivity testing
   - PCR: Rapid, high sensitivity

2. **Legionella urinary antigen test**
   - Detects L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (most common)
   - **Limitation:** Does NOT detect other Legionella species/serogroups
   - Remains positive for days even after antibiotics started

### Specimen Collection Best Practices

**Optimal timing:**
- Collect BEFORE antibiotics if possible
- **BUT:** Do NOT delay antibiotic therapy to obtain specimens
- Can collect after antibiotics have begun

**Concurrent collection:**
- Obtain respiratory specimen AND urine at the same time
- Store per laboratory recommendations

**When to collect respiratory specimens:**
- All severe cases
- Healthcare-associated cases
- Immunocompromised patients
- Outbreak investigations

### Test Limitations

**Urinary antigen:**
- Only detects L. pneumophila serogroup 1
- Other serogroups and species (L. micdadei, L. bozemanii, etc.) require culture/PCR
- Can remain positive for weeks

**Culture:**
- Requires special media (BCYE agar)
- Slow growing (3-5 days)
- Requires respiratory specimen
- Not all laboratories offer testing

**PCR:**
- Rapid turnaround
- High sensitivity
- Not available at all facilities

## Clinical Features

### Legionnaires' Disease

**Incubation period:** 2-10 days (up to 14 days)

**Symptoms:**
- Cough (dry or productive)
- Fever
- Muscle aches
- Headache
- Shortness of breath
- Sometimes: diarrhea, nausea, confusion

**Risk factors for severe disease:**
- Age >50
- Smoking (current or former)
- Chronic lung disease
- Immunosuppression
- Diabetes
- Cancer
- End-stage renal disease

### Pontiac Fever

**Characteristics:**
- Mild, flu-like illness
- Incubation: 24-72 hours
- Symptoms: Fever, muscle aches, headache
- **NO pneumonia**
- Self-limited (resolves in 2-5 days)

**Management:**
- **NO antibiotics needed**
- Supportive care only

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

### Common Sources

**Major outbreak settings:**
- **Healthcare facilities** (hospitals, long-term care)
- **Travel accommodations** (hotels, resorts, cruise ships)
- Water systems with:
  - Stagnation
  - Temperature 77-108°F (25-42°C)
  - Biofilm formation
  - Inadequate disinfection

### Transmission

- **Inhalation** of aerosolized water droplets
- **NOT** person-to-person transmission
- Sources: Cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs, showerheads

### Surveillance

- **Reportable disease** in all 50 states
- Timely reporting allows outbreak detection
- Approximately 10,000 cases reported annually in US
- **Underdiagnosed:** Estimated 5-10x more cases than reported

## Treatment Guidance

### Legionnaires' Disease Treatment

**Refer to specific pneumonia guidelines:**
- Community-acquired: See ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines
- Hospital-acquired: See IDSA HAP/VAP guidelines

**Key points:**
- First-line CAP/HAP regimens don't always include Legionella coverage
- Add **macrolide** (azithromycin) OR **respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) if Legionella suspected
- **Don't delay antibiotics** for diagnostic testing

**Preferred agents:**
- Azithromycin 500mg daily
- Levofloxacin 750mg daily OR 500mg twice daily
- Moxifloxacin 400mg daily

**Duration:**
- Typically 7-10 days for mild-moderate
- 10-14+ days for severe or immunocompromised

**Switch to oral:** When clinically stable and tolerating oral intake

### Pontiac Fever Treatment

**NO antibiotics**
- Self-limited illness
- Supportive care (fluids, antipyretics)
- Resolves within 1 week

## Prevention and Control

### Healthcare Facilities

**Water management program:**
- ASHRAE Standard 188 compliance
- Regular monitoring of water systems
- Temperature management
- Disinfection protocols

**Outbreak response:**
- Epidemiologic investigation
- Environmental sampling
- Remediation of identified sources
- Notification of potentially exposed patients

### Travel-Associated Cases

- Approximately 10-15% of all cases
- Often underdetected due to:
  - Low attack rate
  - Dispersed travelers
  - Time delay between exposure and illness
  - Underdiagnosis

**Importance of travel history:**
- Ask about hotels, resorts, cruise ships
- Report to public health
- May trigger outbreak investigation

## Key Points for Clinicians

1. **Think Legionella** in severe pneumonia, especially with:
   - Travel history
   - Healthcare exposure
   - Outpatient antibiotic failure
   - Immunocompromise

2. **Test appropriately:**
   - Urinary antigen + respiratory culture/PCR
   - Don't delay antibiotics

3. **Report cases:**
   - Public health notification enables outbreak detection
   - Especially important for healthcare and travel-associated cases

4. **Treatment:**
   - Add Legionella-directed antibiotics if suspected
   - Macrolide OR fluoroquinolone
   - Pontiac fever needs NO antibiotics
