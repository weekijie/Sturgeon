# CDC Respiratory Virus Guidance

## Overview

This guidance provides practical recommendations for preventing respiratory virus infections, managing illness, and reducing transmission in community and healthcare settings. It applies to common respiratory viruses including influenza, RSV, COVID-19, and common cold viruses.

## Core Prevention Strategies

### 1. Vaccination

**Key Recommendations:**
- Stay up to date with recommended vaccines for influenza, COVID-19, and RSV (for eligible populations)
- Annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months and older
- COVID-19 vaccination according to current CDC recommendations
- RSV vaccination for adults aged 60+ and pregnant persons (during weeks 32-36 of pregnancy)
- RSV monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab) for infants and young children

### 2. Hygiene and Protective Measures

**Hand Hygiene:**
- Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
- Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) when soap and water unavailable
- Clean hands before eating, after using the bathroom, and after coughing/sneezing

**Respiratory Etiquette:**
- Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper sleeve
- Dispose of tissues properly
- Wash hands after covering coughs/sneezes

**Masking:**
- Consider wearing a mask in crowded or poorly ventilated indoor spaces
- Higher priority for masking when:
  - Community respiratory virus activity is high
  - You are at increased risk for severe illness
  - You have household members at increased risk
  - You have symptoms of respiratory illness

### 3. Ventilation and Air Quality

**Improving Indoor Air:**
- Increase outdoor air ventilation when possible
- Use air filtration systems (HEPA filters)
- Consider portable air cleaners in shared spaces
- Open windows when weather and building systems permit

## When You Are Sick

### Stay Home

**General Guidance:**
- Stay home and away from others if you have respiratory virus symptoms
- Symptoms include: fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, muscle/body aches

**Return to Normal Activities:**
- You can return to normal activities when, for at least 24 hours:
  - Symptoms are improving overall, AND
  - You no longer have fever (without using fever-reducing medication)

### Preventing Spread After Recovery

**Additional Precautions for 5 Days:**
After returning to normal activities, take added precautions for the next 5 days:
- Wear a well-fitting mask around others
- Take steps for cleaner air (ventilation, filtration)
- Practice good hand hygiene
- Maintain physical distance when possible
- Test for respiratory viruses if appropriate

### High-Risk Individuals

**Who Is at Higher Risk for Severe Illness:**
- Older adults (especially 65+)
- Young children (especially under 2 years)
- Pregnant persons
- People with certain medical conditions:
  - Chronic lung disease (asthma, COPD)
  - Heart disease
  - Diabetes
  - Obesity
  - Immunocompromised conditions
  - Chronic kidney or liver disease
  - Neurologic conditions

**Recommendations for High-Risk Individuals:**
- Seek testing and treatment early if symptoms develop
- Contact healthcare provider promptly
- Antiviral medications may be beneficial when started early

## Healthcare Setting Considerations

### Healthcare Personnel

**Work Restrictions:**
- Follow facility-specific policies for healthcare workers with respiratory illness
- Generally, healthcare workers should follow the same guidance as the public
- Additional precautions may be required for workers caring for high-risk patients

### Patient Care

**Prevention:**
- Implement source control measures (masks for symptomatic patients)
- Prioritize isolation rooms for patients with respiratory symptoms
- Use appropriate PPE based on the specific pathogen
- Encourage vaccination of healthcare workers and patients

## Antiviral Treatment

### When to Consider Antivirals

**Influenza:**
- Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), zanamivir (Relenza)
- Most effective when started within 48 hours of symptom onset
- Recommended for:
  - People at higher risk for complications
  - People with severe illness
  - People requiring hospitalization

**COVID-19:**
- Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), remdesivir, molnupiravir
- Most effective when started early (within days of symptom onset)
- For people at higher risk for severe illness

**RSV:**
- No specific antiviral treatment currently approved for most patients
- Supportive care is mainstay of treatment

## Testing Guidance

### When to Test

Consider testing for respiratory viruses when:
- You have symptoms of respiratory illness
- You are at higher risk for severe illness
- Test results would inform treatment decisions
- You have had close contact with someone with known infection
- Testing is required for travel, events, or workplace policies

### Types of Tests

**Antigen Tests:**
- Rapid results (15-30 minutes)
- Lower sensitivity than molecular tests
- May require repeat testing for negative results

**Molecular Tests (PCR):**
- Higher sensitivity
- Longer turnaround time
- May be laboratory-based or point-of-care

## Special Situations

### Outbreak Settings

**Long-term Care Facilities:**
- Enhanced surveillance for respiratory illness
- Prompt implementation of infection control measures
- Consider cohorting of affected residents
- Report outbreaks to public health authorities

**Schools and Childcare:**
- Implement exclusion policies for ill children and staff
- Promote hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette
- Consider temporary closure during significant outbreaks

### Travel Considerations

**Domestic and International Travel:**
- Consider testing before and after travel
- Wear masks in crowded transportation settings
- Monitor for symptoms after travel
- Follow destination-specific requirements
