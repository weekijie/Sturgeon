# WHO Guidelines for Chronic Hepatitis B Infection

## Overview

Hepatitis B (HBV) infection is a major public health problem and cause of chronic liver disease. The 2024 HBV guidelines provide updated evidence-informed recommendations on key priority topics including expanded treatment criteria, antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women, diagnostics, and HDV coinfection.

## Global Burden

- **296 million** people living with chronic HBV infection (2022)
- **1.5 million** new infections annually
- **820,000** deaths annually from HBV-related liver disease and liver cancer
- Major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma

## Transmission

### Routes of Transmission
- Perinatal (mother-to-child)
- Child-to-child (close household contact)
- Unsafe injections and blood transfusions
- Sexual contact
- Needle-sharing among people who inject drugs

### High Prevalence Regions
- WHO Western Pacific Region
- WHO African Region
- WHO South-East Asia Region

## Who to Test

### Priority Populations for Testing

1. **Pregnant women** (for prevention of mother-to-child transmission)
2. **People from high-prevalence countries** (>2% prevalence)
3. **People with HIV infection**
4. **People who inject drugs**
5. **Men who have sex with men**
6. **Sex workers**
7. **Household and sexual contacts** of people with HBV
8. **Healthcare workers**
9. **People receiving immunosuppressive therapy**
10. **Blood and organ donors**
11. **People in prisons and other closed settings**
12. **People with elevated liver enzymes** of unknown cause

## Diagnostic Tests

### Serological Markers

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| HBsAg (positive) | Current HBV infection (acute or chronic) |
| HBsAg (negative) + Anti-HBs (positive) | Resolved infection or vaccination |
| HBeAg (positive) | High viral replication, high infectivity |
| HBeAg (negative) + Anti-HBe (positive) | Low replication, or pre-core/core promoter variants |
| Anti-HBc (positive) | Past or current infection |
| IgM Anti-HBc (positive) | Acute infection |

### HBV DNA Testing

**Used for:**
- Determining treatment eligibility
- Monitoring treatment response
- Diagnosing HBV reactivation
- Assessing risk of mother-to-child transmission

**Point-of-Care HBV DNA Testing:**
- New recommendation in 2024 guidelines
- Enables rapid treatment decisions
- Reflex testing approaches recommended

### Liver Disease Assessment

**Non-invasive Tests:**
- **APRI (AST to Platelet Ratio Index):** Simple, widely available
- **FIB-4:** Combines age, AST, ALT, platelets
- **Transient elastography (FibroScan):** Measures liver stiffness

**APRI Calculation:**
```
APRI = [(AST/ULN) / Platelets (10⁹/L)] × 100
```
- APRI >2: Suggests cirrhosis
- APRI <1: Suggests no significant fibrosis

## Treatment Eligibility

### Who to Treat

**2024 Expanded Criteria (Adults):**
Treat if ANY of the following:

1. **Clinical cirrhosis** (regardless of HBV DNA or ALT)
2. **Age >30 years** + persistently abnormal ALT + HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL
3. **HBV DNA >20,000 IU/mL** + ALT >ULN (upper limit of normal)
4. **HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL** + significant fibrosis (APRI >0.5 or FIB-4 >1.5)
5. **HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL** + any of:
   - Family history of HCC
   - Cirrhosis
   - HIV coinfection
   - Diabetes
   - Metabolic dysfunction

### Adolescents

**Treatment Criteria (Ages 12-17):**
- HBsAg positive for >6 months
- HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL
- ALT >ULN for 6 months
- Informed assent

### Who Not to Treat

**Defer treatment if:**
- No evidence of liver disease
- Normal ALT
- Low HBV DNA (<2000 IU/mL)
- No significant fibrosis

**Continue monitoring** for changes in disease status.

## Antiviral Treatment

### Recommended Drugs

**First-line Options:**
1. **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)** - 300 mg daily
2. **Entecavir (ETV)** - 0.5 mg daily (1 mg if lamivudine-exposed)
3. **Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)** - 25 mg daily
4. **Bespovir** - 150 mg daily (new in 2024 guidelines)

**Advantages of TDF/ETV/TAF:**
- High barrier to resistance
- Potent viral suppression
- Good safety profiles

### Treatment Duration

- **Indefinite/indefinite** for most patients
- **Finite duration** may be considered for:
  - HBeAg-positive patients who achieve HBeAg seroconversion
  - HBsAg loss (functional cure) - treatment can be stopped

### Monitoring During Treatment

**Every 3-6 months:**
- HBV DNA (to assess virological response)
- ALT/AST
- HBsAg (to assess for functional cure)
- Renal function (especially with tenofovir)

**Every 6-12 months:**
- Liver fibrosis assessment
- HCC surveillance (if at risk)

### Adverse Effects

**TDF:**
- Nephrotoxicity (monitor renal function)
- Bone density loss

**TAF:**
- Better bone and renal safety than TDF
- Preferred for patients with renal impairment or osteoporosis risk

**ETV:**
- Generally well-tolerated
- Lower risk of renal effects

## Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission

### Testing in Pregnancy

- All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg
- If positive, test HBV DNA

### Antiviral Prophylaxis (NEW in 2024)

**Expanded Eligibility:**
- HBV DNA ≥200,000 IU/mL **OR**
- HBsAg level ≥4.0 log10 IU/mL

**Recommended Drug:**
- TDF 300 mg daily
- Start at gestational week 28-32
- Continue until at least birth
- Safe for breastfeeding

**Additional Measures:**
- Hepatitis B vaccine at birth (within 24 hours)
- Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) if available

## Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) Coinfection

### Who to Test for HDV

- All people with HBV infection should be tested for HDV at least once
- Repeat testing if ongoing risk factors

### Testing Strategy

1. **Anti-HDV antibody** (screening test)
2. If positive: **HDV RNA** (confirmatory, indicates active infection)

### HDV Treatment

**Pegylated interferon-alpha:**
- Only approved treatment for HDV
- 48 weeks duration
- Limited efficacy (30-40% response)
- Significant side effects

**New therapies in development:**
- Bulevirtide (approved in Europe)
- Clinical trials ongoing

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Surveillance

### Who Needs Surveillance

**All patients with:**
- Cirrhosis (any cause)
- HBV infection (even without cirrhosis) if:
  - Family history of HCC
  - Age >40 years (men) or >50 years (women)
  - High HBV DNA (>2000 IU/mL)
  - Coinfection with HCV, HDV, or HIV

### Surveillance Protocol

- **Abdominal ultrasound** every 6 months
- **Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)** may be added
- Earlier referral for abnormal findings

## Special Populations

### HIV Coinfection

- All people with HIV should be tested for HBV
- Tenofovir (TDF or TAF) treats both HIV and HBV
- Avoid monotherapy for HBV in HIV coinfection

### HCV Coinfection

- Higher risk of cirrhosis and HCC
- Treat HCV first (DAAs)
- Then reassess HBV treatment need

### Healthcare Workers

- Vaccination recommended
- Post-exposure prophylaxis if unvaccinated
- Work restrictions if HBV DNA high (based on procedures)
