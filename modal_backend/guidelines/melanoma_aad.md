# AAD Guidelines for Management of Primary Cutaneous Melanoma

## Overview

Cutaneous melanoma accounts for approximately 5% of all skin cancers but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths. Early detection and appropriate management are critical for improving outcomes. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, biopsy, and staging of primary cutaneous melanoma.

## Risk Factors

### Major Risk Factors
- History of intense intermittent sun exposure
- Fitzpatrick skin types I-II (fair skin, light eyes)
- Family history of melanoma (first-degree relative)
- Personal history of melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer
- Presence of atypical/dysplastic nevi
- Large number of common nevi (>50)
- History of indoor tanning
- Immunosuppression
- Genetic syndromes (CDKN2A, CDK4 mutations)

### High-Risk Populations
- Men: Higher incidence on trunk
- Women: Higher incidence on lower extremities
- Age >50 years
- Organ transplant recipients
- Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum

## ABCDE Criteria for Clinical Detection

The ABCDE criteria help identify suspicious pigmented lesions:

### A - Asymmetry
One half of the lesion does not match the other half in shape or size.

### B - Border Irregularity
Edges are ragged, notched, blurred, or irregular in outline.

### C - Color Variation
Color is uneven, with shades of black, brown, tan, white, gray, red, or blue.

### D - Diameter
Typically >6mm in diameter (approximately the size of a pencil eraser).

### E - Evolution
**Most important criterion** — any change in size, shape, color, or new symptom (itching, bleeding, ulceration).

### The "Ugly Duckling" Sign
A lesion that looks different from the patient's other nevi should raise suspicion, regardless of ABCDE criteria.

## Clinical Presentation

### Common Subtypes

**Superior Spreading Melanoma (SSM)**
- Most common subtype (70%)
- Typically arises in sun-exposed areas
- Often has radial growth phase before vertical invasion

**Nodular Melanoma**
- 15-30% of melanomas
- More aggressive, often diagnosed at thicker Breslow depth
- May lack ABCDE features
- Often appears as rapidly growing dark nodule

**Lentigo Maligna Melanoma**
- 5-15% of melanomas
- Occurs on chronically sun-damaged skin (face, neck)
- Presents as slowly expanding pigmented macule

**Acral Lentiginous Melanoma**
- 5-10% of melanomas
- Occurs on palms, soles, nail apparatus
- Most common subtype in darker-skinned individuals
- May present as dark streak in nail (melanonychia)

## Biopsy Recommendations

### Recommended Technique
**Excisional biopsy with 1-3mm margins** is the preferred method for suspicious pigmented lesions.

**Advantages:**
- Provides complete architectural assessment
- Allows accurate Breslow depth measurement
- Preserves lymphatic drainage patterns

### Alternative Techniques

**Deep shave (saucerization) biopsy:**
- Acceptable if excisional biopsy not feasible
- Must be deep enough to avoid transecting the lesion
- Should extend into subcutaneous fat

**Punch biopsy:**
- Use 4-6mm punch for larger lesions
- Sample the thickest/darkest area
- May need multiple punches for large lesions

### Biopsy Principles
1. **Never** perform shave biopsy that transects the lesion
2. Avoid cautery/electrosurgery (distorts histology)
3. Orient specimen with suture for site identification
4. Document clinical features and differential diagnosis
5. Send specimen with complete clinical history

## Histologic Assessment

### Required Elements for Pathology Report

**Breslow Depth (Thickness)**
- Measured from granular layer to deepest tumor cell
- Critical for staging and treatment planning
- Measured in millimeters

**Ulceration Status**
- Presence or absence of ulceration affects staging
- Ulceration indicates worse prognosis

**Mitotic Rate**
- Number of mitoses per mm²
- Higher rate associated with worse prognosis
- Used for staging T1 lesions

**Margin Status**
- Lateral and deep margins
- Positive margins require re-excision

## Staging (AJCC 8th Edition)

### T Classification (Tumor Thickness)

| Category | Breslow Depth | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Tis | In situ | Confined to epidermis |
| T1 | ≤1.0 mm | T1a: <0.8mm without ulceration; T1b: 0.8-1.0mm or ulcerated |
| T2 | 1.01-2.0 mm | Subdivided by ulceration status |
| T3 | 2.01-4.0 mm | Subdivided by ulceration status |
| T4 | >4.0 mm | Subdivided by ulceration status |

### N Classification (Regional Lymph Nodes)

| Category | Nodes Involved |
|----------|----------------|
| N0 | No regional metastasis |
| N1 | 1 node or in-transit/satellite without nodes |
| N2 | 2-3 nodes |
| N3 | ≥4 nodes or matted nodes |

### M Classification (Distant Metastasis)

| Category | Site |
|----------|------|
| M1a | Distant skin, subcutaneous, or nodal |
| M1b | Lung |
| M1c | Other visceral sites |
| M1d | Brain |

## Surgical Management

### Wide Local Excision Margins

| Breslow Depth | Recommended Margin |
|---------------|-------------------|
| In situ | 5-10 mm |
| ≤1.0 mm | 1 cm |
| 1.01-2.0 mm | 1-2 cm |
| 2.01-4.0 mm | 2 cm |
| >4.0 mm | 2 cm |

### Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)

**Indications:**
- T1b or higher (≥0.8mm or ulcerated)
- Consider for T1a with adverse features
- Provides prognostic information
- May guide adjuvant therapy decisions

**Not recommended:**
- Melanoma in situ
- T1a (<0.8mm) without adverse features

## Follow-Up Recommendations

### Stage-Based Surveillance

| Stage | Follow-Up Frequency | Duration |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| 0 (in situ) | Annual skin exam | Lifetime |
| I | Every 6-12 months | 5 years, then annual |
| II | Every 3-6 months | 2 years, then every 6-12 months |
| III | Every 3 months | 2 years, then every 6 months |

### Surveillance Components
- Complete skin examination
- Lymph node examination
- Patient self-examination education
- Imaging as clinically indicated (CT, PET, MRI for stage III-IV)

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy
- Melanoma is the most common cancer in pregnancy
- Pregnancy does not affect prognosis
- Treatment should not be delayed
- SLNB safe during pregnancy

### Pediatric Melanoma
- Rare but increasing incidence
- ABCD criteria may not apply in prepubertal children
- Consider atypical Spitz tumors in differential
- Similar management principles as adults

### Immunocompromised Patients
- Higher risk of melanoma
- May have more aggressive course
- Same management principles apply
- Consider more intensive surveillance

## When to Refer

### Immediate Dermatology Referral
- Any suspicious pigmented lesion
- Lesion meeting ABCDE criteria
- "Ugly duckling" lesion
- Changing mole
- Non-healing pigmented lesion

### Melanoma Center Referral
- Confirmed melanoma diagnosis
- Breslow depth ≥1mm
- Positive sentinel lymph node
- Advanced stage (III-IV)
- Complex management decisions

## Patient Education

### Sun Protection
- Broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30+
- Protective clothing
- Avoid peak sun hours (10am-4pm)
- No indoor tanning

### Self-Examination
- Monthly skin self-exams
- Use mirror for hard-to-see areas
- Document existing moles (photos)
- Report any new or changing lesions promptly

## Key Recommendations Summary

1. **Excisional biopsy** with 1-3mm margins is preferred for suspicious lesions
2. **Breslow depth** is the most important prognostic factor
3. **Sentinel lymph node biopsy** indicated for T1b and higher
4. **Wide local excision** margins based on Breslow depth
5. **ABCDE criteria** and "ugly duckling" sign aid clinical detection
6. **Evolution** (change over time) is the most important ABCDE criterion
7. **Regular follow-up** essential for early detection of recurrence
