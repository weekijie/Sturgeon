# WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis: Prevention

## Overview

About **one fourth of the world's population** is estimated to have been infected with TB bacilli. About **5-10%** of those infected develop TB disease in their lifetime. TB preventive treatment (TPT) given to people at highest risk of progressing from TB infection to disease remains a critical element to achieve global targets.

## Risk of Progression to TB Disease

**Risk Factors for Progression:**
- Immunological status is most important factor
- HIV infection
- Recent TB infection (<2 years)
- Children under 5 years
- Diabetes mellitus
- Silicosis
- Chronic renal failure
- Malnutrition
- Tobacco smoking
- Alcohol abuse
- Immunosuppressive therapy

## Cascade of Care for TPT

1. **Identify individuals at highest risk**
2. **Screen for TB and rule out TB disease**
3. **Test for TB infection** (optional in some settings)
4. **Choose the preventive treatment option**
5. **Manage adverse events**
6. **Support medication adherence**
7. **Monitor programmatic performance**

## Populations for TPT

### Priority Groups

**1. People Living with HIV**
- Strong recommendation for all PLHIV
- Regardless of TB infection test result
- Includes children, adolescents, and adults

**2. Household Contacts of TB Cases**
- All household contacts of infectious TB cases
- Especially children under 5 years
- Contacts of drug-susceptible TB
- Contacts of MDR/RR-TB (new recommendation)

**3. Clinical Risk Groups**
- Patients initiating anti-TNF treatment
- Patients receiving dialysis
- Patients preparing for organ transplantation
- Patients with silicosis

## Screening for TB Disease

### Symptom Screening

**Adults and Adolescents:**
- Current cough
- Fever
- Weight loss
- Night sweats

**Children:**
- Current cough
- Fever
- Weight loss or poor weight gain
- Lethargy or reduced playfulness

**If any symptom positive:**
- Further evaluation for TB disease
- Chest X-ray, sputum testing as appropriate
- Rule out active TB before starting TPT

## Testing for TB Infection

### Available Tests

**1. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)**
- Intradermal injection of tuberculin
- Read induration at 48-72 hours
- Positive: ≥5 mm (HIV, contacts) or ≥10 mm (general population)
- Limitations: Cross-reactivity with BCG, need for return visit

**2. Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs)**
- Blood test measuring immune response to TB antigens
- More specific than TST (no cross-reactivity with BCG)
- More expensive, requires laboratory capacity

**3. Novel TB Infection Tests**
- Cy-TB (novel skin test)
- QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus
- T-SPOT.TB

### When Testing is Optional

In high-incidence settings or for PLHIV, TPT may be offered regardless of test result due to:
- High pre-test probability of infection
- High risk of progression
- Limited availability of tests

## TB Preventive Treatment Options

### Short-Course Regimens (Preferred)

**1. 3HP (Rifapentine + Isoniazid) - 3 months**
- Weekly dosing (12 doses)
- Adult and pediatric formulations available
- High completion rates
- Equivalent efficacy to longer regimens

**2. 1HP (Rifapentine + Isoniazid) - 1 month**
- Daily dosing (30 doses)
- For adults and adolescents ≥13 years
- Excellent completion rates
- Limited pediatric data

**3. 3HR (Isoniazid + Rifampicin) - 3 months**
- Daily dosing
- Alternative when rifapentine unavailable

**4. 4R (Rifampicin alone) - 4 months**
- Daily dosing
- Simpler than isoniazid regimens
- Lower hepatotoxicity risk

### Longer Regimens

**6H (Isoniazid alone) - 6 months**
- Daily dosing
- Traditional regimen
- Lower completion rates
- Higher hepatotoxicity risk with longer duration

**9H (Isoniazid alone) - 9 months**
- For HIV-positive individuals not on ART
- Historically recommended
- Replaced by shorter regimens when available

### MDR/RR-TB Contacts

**Recommended Regimens:**
- 6 months of daily delamanid
- Or 6 months of daily levofloxacin + delamanid

**This is a NEW strong recommendation in the 2024 guidelines.**

## Dosing by Weight

### 3HP Weekly Dosing

| Weight (kg) | Rifapentine (mg) | Isoniazid (mg) |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| <12 | 300 | 150 |
| 12-15.9 | 450 | 225 |
| 16-23.9 | 600 | 300 |
| 24-34.9 | 750 | 375 |
| 35-49.9 | 900 | 450 |
| ≥50 | 900 | 450 |

## Adverse Events

### Hepatotoxicity
- Most significant adverse event
- More common with isoniazid, especially with longer regimens
- Monitor for symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice
- Discontinue if:
  - AST/ALT >3x ULN with symptoms
  - AST/ALT >5x ULN without symptoms

### Other Adverse Events
- **Rifamycins:** Orange discoloration of bodily fluids, drug interactions (CYP450 induction)
- **Fluoroquinolones:** Tendinitis, QT prolongation, CNS effects
- **Delamanid:** QT prolongation, monitor ECG

## Monitoring and Adherence

### Clinical Monitoring
- Monthly clinical assessment
- Symptom screening for adverse events
- Weight monitoring (dose adjustment as needed)

### Laboratory Monitoring
- Baseline liver function tests for high-risk patients
- Repeat LFTs if symptoms develop

### Adherence Support
- Digital adherence technologies (DOT, SMS reminders)
- Community health worker support
- Family/friend treatment supporters
- Flexible clinic hours
- Patient education

## Contraindications to TPT

### Absolute Contraindications
- Active TB disease
- Previous severe adverse reaction to TPT drugs
- Severe liver disease

### Relative Contraindications/Cautions
- Pregnancy (defer if possible, but not absolute)
- Heavy alcohol use
- Pre-existing liver disease
- Drug interactions (especially with rifamycins)

## Special Populations

### Children
- Higher risk of progression
- Include children <5 years as priority
- Pediatric formulations available for 3HP
- Weight-based dosing essential

### Pregnancy
- Generally defer until after delivery
- Exceptions: HIV infection, recent contact
- Rifamycins can be used (rifampicin is category C)
- Isoniazid can be used with pyridoxine

### People with HIV
- Priority population
- Start regardless of CD4 count or ART status
- Check for drug interactions:
  - Rifampicin: reduces many ARV levels
  - Rifapentine: can be used with efavirenz, dolutegravir
