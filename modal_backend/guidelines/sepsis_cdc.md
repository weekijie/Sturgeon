# CDC Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements

## Overview

Sepsis is defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection." It is a leading cause of hospitalization and hospital mortality, contributing to over a third of all hospital deaths. In the United States, there are an estimated 1.7 million adult sepsis hospitalizations annually, of which 350,000 result in hospital death or discharge to hospice.

## Burden of Sepsis

Beyond being a major driver of hospital mortality, sepsis also contributes to incident disability. Patients who survive hospitalization for sepsis are at increased risk for:
- Development of new morbidity
- Inability to return to work
- Hospital readmission
- Death

The World Health Organization recognized sepsis as a global health priority in 2017.

## Core Elements Summary

The development of a multi-disciplinary hospital sepsis program is critical to monitoring and improving the management and outcomes of patients with sepsis.

### 1. Hospital Leadership Commitment

Support from hospital and health system leadership, especially that of the chief medical and chief nursing officers, is critical to the success of hospital sepsis programs.

**Priority Examples:**
- Providing the sepsis program leader(s) with dedicated time to manage the program
- Providing resources, including data analytics and information technology support
- Ensuring relevant staff from key clinical groups have sufficient time to contribute
- Appointing a senior administrator to serve as an executive sponsor
- Identifying sepsis as a hospital priority

### 2. Accountability

Hospital sepsis programs should have one leader or two co-leaders who are accountable for program management and outcomes.

**Priority Examples:**
- Identifying a single clinician leader or two co-leaders (strongly recommend physician and nurse co-leaders)
- Setting ambitious but achievable goals for improving sepsis care and patient outcomes
- Assessing progress towards goals at regular intervals
- Identifying physician and nurse champions at each hospital

### 3. Multi-professional Expertise

Sepsis programs require engagement of multidisciplinary partners throughout the hospital.

**Priority Examples:**
- Having a dedicated sepsis coordinator
- Collaborating across hospital locations (ED, inpatient wards, ICUs)
- Engaging multi-professional experts: antimicrobial stewardship, critical care, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, infectious diseases, nursing, pharmacy, social work
- Engaging relevant support services: data management, information technology, quality improvement

### 4. Action

The main goal of hospital sepsis programs is to improve the treatment and outcomes of patients with sepsis.

**Priority Examples:**

**Implementing a standardized process to screen for sepsis:**
- Early administration of sepsis treatment is lifesaving
- Hospitals should have a standardized process to screen at-risk patients upon presentation and throughout hospitalization
- Screening may use paper-based or electronic health record-based tools
- Screening should occur at standard recurring intervals (e.g., every 8-12 hours) and/or in response to clinical events

**Developing hospital guidelines or standardized care pathways:**
- Guidelines should address management across the continuum of hospital care
- Include screening, clinical evaluation, diagnosis, antimicrobial selection, source control, fluid resuscitation
- Recommendations should be based on published guidelines and local epidemiology
- Empiric antimicrobial options should be recommended in conjunction with Antimicrobial Stewardship

**Structures and processes to facilitate prompt delivery of antimicrobials:**
- Timely delivery of antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is life-saving
- It has been estimated that one-third of the interval from patient presentation to antimicrobial delivery occurs after the antimicrobial order
- Post-order delays are associated with increased mortality
- Options: stocking antimicrobials in ED/ICU/wards, immediate order processing, default to immediate administration

**Structures and processes to support effective hospital hand-offs:**
- Transfers between units and between treating clinicians are high-risk times for information loss
- Incomplete awareness of working diagnosis contributes to lapses in subsequent care
- Structured communication processes are consistently associated with reduced errors

**Peri-discharge evaluation:**
- Survivors may experience new or worsening functional limitations, cognitive impairment, PTSD/anxiety symptoms
- Up to 40% of patients are re-hospitalized within three months
- Common causes: recurrent infection, heart failure exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, acute renal failure

### 5. Tracking

Tracking of sepsis epidemiology, management, and outcomes is critical for identifying gaps, trends, and improvement opportunities.

**Categories of Tracking:**
1. Sepsis epidemiology metrics (case volume, community-onset vs hospital-onset)
2. Sepsis management metrics (antimicrobial timing, fluid administration)
3. Sepsis outcomes metrics (mortality, ICU admission, length of stay)
4. Progress towards achieving sepsis program goals
5. Use, usability, and impact of sepsis program tools
6. Chart reviews of sepsis hospitalizations

**Defining and Counting Sepsis Hospitalizations:**
- Sepsis has been broadly defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection"
- Different approaches are needed to identify sepsis hospitalizations depending on setting and patient population
- The CDC Adult Sepsis Event (CDC ASE) criteria can be used for benchmarking

### 6. Reporting

Providing information on sepsis management and outcomes to relevant partners.

**Priority Examples:**
- Sharing outcome data with hospital leadership
- Reporting on adherence to sepsis bundles
- Providing feedback to front-line clinicians
- Engaging patients and families in quality improvement

### 7. Education

Providing sepsis education to healthcare professionals, patients, and family/caregivers.

**Priority Examples:**
- Training healthcare staff on sepsis recognition and management
- Educating patients and families on signs and symptoms of sepsis
- Providing ongoing education through webinars, simulations, and case reviews

## Getting Started

For hospitals or healthcare systems just starting a sepsis program or those with limited resources:

1. Identify the sepsis program leader or co-leaders
2. Secure support from hospital or healthcare system leadership
3. Conduct a needs analysis to identify applicable regulatory or reporting requirements
4. Establish initial goals for sepsis program based on needs analysis

## Antibiotic Stewardship and Sepsis

There have been some misperceptions that antibiotic stewardship may hinder efforts to improve management of sepsis. However, rather than hindering effective patient care, antibiotic stewardship programs can play an important role in optimizing the use of antibiotics, leading to better patient outcomes. It is possible for hospitals to make simultaneous improvement in sepsis management and antimicrobial stewardship.

## Key Clinical Recommendations

### Time to Antibiotics
- Early administration of antimicrobials in sepsis is life-saving
- Post-order delays are associated with increased mortality
- Target: prompt delivery after order placement

### Fluid Resuscitation
- Indications, contraindications, type, and volume should be specified in hospital guidelines
- Tailor to patient population and clinical presentation

### Source Control
- Identify and address source of infection
- May require surgical or interventional radiology procedures

### Monitoring
- Lactate measurement within 3 hours of presentation in community-onset sepsis
- Remeasurement if initial lactate elevated
- Monitor for organ dysfunction progression
