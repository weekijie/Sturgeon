# Pneumonia Severity Assessment and Management

## Overview

This review provides practical guidance on pneumonia severity assessment, helping clinicians determine appropriate site of care and treatment intensity.

## Clinical Presentation

### Typical Symptoms
- Acute onset fever or chills
- Cough (productive or dry)
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Fatigue and anorexia

### Physical Examination Findings
- Decreased breath sounds
- Crackles/rales
- Tactile fremitus
- Tachypnea (RR >20) - concerning sign
- Hypotension (SBP <90) - urgent

### Elderly/Atypical Presentations
- May lack typical symptoms
- Confusion or altered mental status
- Falls
- Decreased appetite
- Functional impairment
- **Lower threshold for imaging and treatment**

## Diagnostic Testing

### Chest Imaging
- **Indicated when:** Temperature >100°F, HR >100, RR >20, or abnormal lung exam
- **Role:** Confirms pneumonia, identifies complications, excludes mimics
- **Note:** 1 in 10 with clinical CAP but normal initial CXR develop radiographic pneumonia within 72 hours

### Microbiological Testing

**Limited value in outpatients** - low yield and doesn't change management

**Indicated for hospitalized patients:**
- Blood cultures (before antibiotics)
- Sputum culture (purulent sputum available)
- Legionella urinary antigen (severe disease, ICU, travel)
- Pneumococcal urinary antigen (severe disease, leukopenia, asplenia)

**Respiratory viral PCR:** Consider to limit inappropriate antibiotics

## Severity Assessment Tools

### Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI/PORT Score)

Uses **20 variables** to assign patients to 5 risk classes (I-V).

**Advantages:**
- Well-validated
- Identifies larger proportion of low-risk patients
- Higher discriminative power for mortality prediction

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex (requires 20 data points)
- Less practical in emergency settings
- Requires laboratory values

**Classes:**
- Class I-II: Low risk (mortality <1%) - Outpatient
- Class III: Intermediate risk (mortality 1-5%) - Observation/brief admission
- Class IV-V: High risk (mortality >5%) - Hospital admission

### CURB-65 Score

Uses **5 variables** (1 point each):
- **C**onfusion (new onset)
- **U**rea >7 mmol/L (BUN >20 mg/dL)
- **R**espiratory rate ≥30/min
- **B**lood pressure <90 systolic or ≤60 diastolic
- **65** years or older

**Advantages:**
- Simple and rapid
- Validated across multiple settings
- Easy to remember

**Interpretation:**
- **0-1 point:** Low risk (mortality <2%) - Outpatient treatment
- **2 points:** Moderate risk (mortality 3-5%) - Hospital admission or close outpatient follow-up
- **3+ points:** High risk (mortality >5%) - Hospital admission, consider ICU if 4-5 points

### CRB-65 (Community Setting)

Same as CURB-65 but **without urea** (no blood test needed):
- **C**onfusion
- **R**espiratory rate ≥30
- **B**lood pressure <90/60
- **65** years or older

**Interpretation:**
- **0:** Low risk - Home treatment
- **1-2:** Intermediate - Consider hospital assessment
- **3-4:** High risk - Hospital admission

### Comparison of Tools

| Tool | Variables | Best Use | Limitations |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| PSI | 20 | Identifying low-risk outpatients | Complex, needs labs |
| CURB-65 | 5 | Rapid triage, hospital decisions | Less sensitive for low-risk |
| CRB-65 | 4 | Community settings, no labs | Less precise |

**Meta-analysis findings:** No significant difference in test performance between tools. PSI may be better at identifying low-risk; CURB/CRB-65 better at identifying high-risk.

## Site of Care Decision

### Outpatient Criteria
- CURB-65: 0-1 points
- PSI: Class I-II
- Able to tolerate oral medications
- Reliable follow-up available
- No hypoxemia (or on home oxygen)
- Social support adequate

### Hospital Admission Criteria
- CURB-65 ≥2
- PSI Class III-V
- Hypoxemia (SaO2 <90% or PaO2 <60)
- Multilobar involvement
- Confusion/dehydration
- Failure of outpatient therapy
- Unreliable social situation

### ICU Criteria
- CURB-65 ≥4
- Respiratory failure requiring support
- Septic shock
- RR >30 despite resuscitation
- Multilobar consolidation
- PaO2/FiO2 ≤250

## Treatment Principles by Severity

### Mild (Outpatient)
- **Healthy adults:** Macrolide OR doxycycline
- **With comorbidities:** Beta-lactam + macrolide OR fluoroquinolone alone
- **Duration:** 5-7 days

### Moderate (Hospital Ward)
- Beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam) + macrolide
- OR Fluoroquinolone alone
- Switch to oral when clinically stable
- **Duration:** 5-7 days (minimum 5 days + 48-72 hours afebrile)

### Severe (ICU)
- Beta-lactam + macrolide + consider MRSA/Pseudomonas coverage
- Aggressive supportive care
- Early source control if complications
- **Duration:** 7-10 days or longer

## Special Considerations

### Non-resolving Pneumonia

**Definition:** Inadequate clinical response after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotics

**Causes ("BAD OMEN" mnemonic):**
- **B**ronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans
- **A**spiration, age >60, atypical pathogens
- **D**rug resistance, drug-induced pneumonitis
- **O**pportunistic pathogens (fungi, PCP)
- **M**isdiagnosis (TB, cancer, PE)
- **E**mpyema, embolism, eosinophilic pneumonia
- **N**eoplasm, nosocomial superinfection

**Workup:** Repeat imaging, CT chest, bronchoscopy with BAL, pleural tap if effusion

### Risk Factors for Resistant Organisms

Consider MRSA coverage if:
- Prior MRSA colonization/infection
- Recent hospitalization
- Injection drug use
- Healthcare-associated pneumonia

Consider Pseudomonas coverage if:
- Structural lung disease (bronchiectasis)
- Recent broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Corticosteroid use

## Prognosis

- Most patients improve within 48-72 hours
- Mortality overall: <1% (outpatient) to 10-20% (ICU)
- Delayed antibiotic therapy increases mortality
- Follow-up chest X-ray at 6 weeks if:
  - Age >50
  - >30 pack-year smoking history
  - Persistent symptoms
  - Suspicious radiographic features
