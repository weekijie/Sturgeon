# USPSTF Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Screening Recommendation

## Recommendation Summary

| Population | Recommendation | Grade |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Asymptomatic adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity | The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. | B |

## Importance

According to the CDC 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report:
- **13% of all US adults** have diabetes
- **34.5%** meet criteria for prediabetes
- **21.4%** of persons with diabetes were not aware of or did not report having diabetes
- Only **15.3%** of persons with prediabetes reported being told by a health professional they had this condition

**Complications of Diabetes:**
- Leading cause of kidney failure
- Leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults
- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
- Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis
- Seventh leading cause of death in the US (2017)

## What's New

The USPSTF has **lowered the starting age of screening from 40 to 35 years**.

## Who Should Be Screened

**This recommendation applies to:**
- Nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years
- Seen in primary care settings
- Have overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 or ≥30)
- No symptoms of diabetes

### Risk Factors

**Strongest Risk Factors:**
- Overweight and obesity

**Other Risk Factors:**
- Older age
- Family history of diabetes
- History of gestational diabetes
- History of polycystic ovarian syndrome
- Dietary and lifestyle factors

**Populations with Higher Prevalence:**
- American Indian/Alaska Native: 14.7%
- Asian: 9.2%
- Hispanic/Latino: 12.5%
- Non-Hispanic Black: 11.7%
- Non-Hispanic White: 7.5%

**Consider screening at earlier age if:**
- From population with disproportionately high prevalence
- Family history of diabetes
- History of gestational diabetes
- History of polycystic ovarian syndrome

**For Asian Americans:**
- Consider screening at lower BMI (≥23) due to differences in body composition

## Screening Tests

### Diagnostic Criteria

| Condition | Fasting Plasma Glucose | HbA1c | 2-hour Postload Glucose |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
| Diabetes | ≥126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) | ≥6.5% | ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) |
| Prediabetes | 100-125 mg/dL (5.55-6.94 mmol/L) | 5.7-6.4% | 140-199 mg/dL (7.77-11.04 mmol/L) |

### Test Options

1. **Fasting Plasma Glucose**
   - Requires 8-hour fast
   - Simple and widely available

2. **HbA1c**
   - No fasting required
   - Measures long-term blood glucose (2-3 months)
   - Not affected by acute glucose changes
   - More convenient than fasting tests

3. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test**
   - Morning test in fasting state
   - Blood glucose measured 2 hours after 75-g oral glucose load
   - More complex than other options

**Confirmation:**
- Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing

## Screening Intervals

Evidence on optimal screening interval is limited. Cohort and modeling studies suggest:
- **Screening every 3 years** may be reasonable for adults with normal blood glucose levels

## Preventive Interventions

### Lifestyle Interventions

**Diet and Physical Activity:**
- Focus on both diet/nutrition and physical activity
- High-contact interventions (>360 minutes) are most effective
- More effective than metformin in preventing/delaying diabetes

**Benefits Beyond Diabetes Prevention:**
- Weight reduction
- Blood pressure reduction
- Improved lipid levels (increased HDL, decreased triglycerides)

**Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Results:**
- Effective in all subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI)
- 22% relative reduction in progression to diabetes

### Metformin

**Effectiveness:**
- 27% relative reduction in progression to diabetes
- Less effective than lifestyle intervention overall

**Best Candidates:**
- Age <60 years
- BMI ≥35
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥110 mg/dL
- History of gestational diabetes

**Benefits:**
- Weight reduction (average 2 kg)
- No significant effect on blood pressure or lipids

**Note:** Metformin has not been FDA-approved specifically for prediabetes prevention.

## Benefits of Screening

**Evidence from UKPDS (Newly Diagnosed Diabetes):**
- Intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin:
  - 13% reduction in all-cause mortality over 20 years
  - 17% reduction in diabetes-related mortality
  - 15% reduction in myocardial infarction

**Intensive glucose control with metformin (in overweight persons):**
- 36% reduction in all-cause mortality at 10-year follow-up
- 42% reduction in diabetes-related mortality
- 39% reduction in myocardial infarction

## Harms of Screening

### Psychological Harms
- Possible short-term increases in anxiety (at 6 weeks) among those diagnosed
- No clinically significant differences in anxiety, depression, worry, or self-reported health overall

### Treatment Harms

**Lifestyle Interventions:**
- Musculoskeletal symptoms (higher rates in DPP: 24.1 vs 21.1 events per 100 person-years)

**Metformin:**
- Gastrointestinal adverse events (higher rates)
- Rare: lactic acidosis (primarily in significant renal impairment)

**Insulin and Sulfonylureas:**
- Hypoglycemia (including serious events requiring medical attention)
- UKPDS: 1 death from hypoglycemia (insulin user)
- Serious hypoglycemic events: 1-1.8% across treatment groups

## Implementation

### Step 1: Assess Risk
- Obtain height and weight measurements
- Calculate BMI
- Identify if BMI ≥25 (overweight) or ≥30 (obesity)

### Step 2: Screen
- If aged 35-70 years with overweight or obesity: offer screening
- Earlier age for high-prevalence populations
- Lower BMI threshold (≥23) for Asian Americans

### Step 3: Follow-Up
- If prediabetes: offer or refer to preventive interventions
- If diabetes: confirm diagnosis and initiate treatment
- If normal: rescreen in 3 years
