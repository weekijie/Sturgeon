# WHO Guidelines on Meningitis Diagnosis, Treatment and Care

## Overview

In line with the "Defeating meningitis by 2030: a global road map," these WHO guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of children and adults with community-acquired meningitis, including acute and long-term care.

**Key Facts:**
- Approximately **1 in 5** individuals affected by bacterial meningitis incurs long-term complications
- Burden of morbidity and mortality remains high, particularly in low- and middle-income countries
- Long-term complications may result in disability and profound impact on quality of life

## Target Audience

- Healthcare professionals in first- or second-level healthcare facilities
- Emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services
- Policy-makers, healthcare planners, and programme managers
- Academic institutions, NGOs, and civil society organizations

## Clinical Presentation

### Classic Triad (Adults)
- Fever
- Neck stiffness
- Altered mental status

### Additional Symptoms
- Severe headache
- Photophobia
- Nausea and vomiting
- Seizures

### Pediatric Presentation
- Fever
- Irritability
- Lethargy
- Poor feeding
- Bulging fontanelle (infants)
- Seizures

### Warning Signs of Severe Illness
- Altered consciousness
- Seizures
- Focal neurological deficits
- Shock
- Petechial/purpuric rash (meningococcal meningitis)

## Diagnostic Approach

### Lumbar Puncture

**Indications:**
- Suspected meningitis in all patients unless contraindicated

**Contraindications:**
- Signs of increased intracranial pressure
- Focal neurological deficits
- Severe coagulopathy
- Local infection at puncture site
- Hemodynamically unstable patient

**CSF Analysis:**
| Parameter | Bacterial Meningitis | Viral Meningitis |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Opening pressure | Elevated (20-30 cm H2O) | Normal or slightly elevated |
| WBC count | Elevated (100-5000/μL) | Elevated (10-1000/μL) |
| Differential | Neutrophil predominance | Lymphocytic predominance |
| Protein | Elevated (100-500 mg/dL) | Normal or slightly elevated |
| Glucose | Low (<40 mg/dL or <40% serum) | Normal |
| Gram stain | Positive in 60-90% | Negative |

### Blood Tests
- Complete blood count
- Blood cultures (before antibiotics if possible)
- C-reactive protein or procalcitonin
- Serum glucose (for comparison with CSF glucose)
- Coagulation studies

### Imaging
**CT Head Indications:**
- Altered mental status
- Focal neurological deficits
- Signs of increased intracranial pressure
- Immunocompromised patient
- New-onset seizure

## Empiric Treatment

### Initial Antibiotic Therapy

**Age-based Empiric Coverage:**

| Age Group | Common Pathogens | Empiric Regimen |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Neonates (0-28 days) | Group B Strep, E. coli, Listeria | Ampicillin + Gentamicin OR Ampicillin + Cefotaxime |
| Infants (1-3 months) | S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, Group B Strep | Cefotaxime or Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin |
| Children/Adults | S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis | Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime + Vancomycin |
| Immunocompromised | Listeria, Gram-negative bacilli | Ampicillin + Cefotaxime + Vancomycin |

**Timing:**
- Administer antibiotics **as soon as possible** after obtaining cultures
- Do not delay antibiotics for CT scan if clinical suspicion is high
- Goal: antibiotics within 1 hour of presentation

### Adjunctive Steroids

**Recommendation:**
- Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 days
- Administer **before or with** first dose of antibiotics
- Primarily recommended for **suspected or proven pneumococcal meningitis** in high-income settings

**Evidence:**
- Reduces risk of hearing loss and neurological sequelae
- Benefit primarily in pneumococcal meningitis
- Limited evidence of mortality benefit

### Duration of Therapy

| Pathogen | Duration |
|----------|----------|
| Neisseria meningitidis | 7 days |
| Haemophilus influenzae | 7 days |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae | 10-14 days |
| Listeria monocytogenes | 21+ days |
| Gram-negative bacilli | 21+ days |

## Specific Pathogens

### Neisseria meningitidis (Meningococcal)

**Characteristics:**
- Most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults
- Can cause meningococcemia (sepsis with petechial/purpuric rash)

**Treatment:**
- Penicillin G, ampicillin, or ceftriaxone/cefotaxime
- 7 days duration
- Chemoprophylaxis for close contacts

**Chemoprophylaxis:**
- Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for close contacts
- Indicated for household contacts, daycare contacts, healthcare workers with direct exposure

### Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcal)

**Characteristics:**
- Most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults
- Higher rates of hearing loss and neurological complications

**Treatment:**
- Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + vancomycin (until susceptibilities known)
- Consider dexamethasone as adjunct
- 10-14 days duration

**Penicillin-resistant strains:**
- Add vancomycin to empiric regimen
- May need rifampin if persistent

### Haemophilus influenzae type b

**Characteristics:**
- Previously common in children; reduced by vaccination
- Still occurs in unvaccinated populations

**Treatment:**
- Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime
- 7 days duration

### Listeria monocytogenes

**Characteristics:**
- Important in neonates, elderly, immunocompromised
- Not covered by cephalosporins

**Treatment:**
- Ampicillin or penicillin + gentamicin
- 21+ days duration
- Add gentamicin for synergy in severe cases

## Supportive Care

### Airway and Ventilation
- Maintain airway protection
- Mechanical ventilation for altered consciousness or respiratory failure

### Hemodynamic Support
- IV fluids for hypotension/shock
- Vasopressors if needed

### Seizure Management
- Anticonvulsants for seizures
- EEG monitoring for persistent altered consciousness

### Increased Intracranial Pressure
- Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees
- Osmotic therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline) for clinical deterioration
- Consider ICP monitoring in severe cases

## Complications and Long-term Sequelae

### Acute Complications
- Seizures
- Cerebral edema
- Hydrocephalus
- Venous sinus thrombosis
- Subdural empyema
- Brain abscess
- Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

### Long-term Sequelae
- Hearing loss (10-30%)
- Cognitive impairment
- Motor deficits
- Seizure disorder
- Vision loss
- Behavioral and learning difficulties

### Follow-up
- Audiological evaluation (hearing testing)
- Neurological assessment
- Developmental assessment in children
- Rehabilitation services as needed

## Prevention

### Vaccination
- **MenACWY** (meningococcal conjugate) - routine in adolescents
- **MenB** (serogroup B) - for high-risk groups
- **PCV13/PCV20** (pneumococcal conjugate) - routine in children
- **PPSV23** (pneumococcal polysaccharide) - for high-risk adults
- **Hib** (Haemophilus influenzae type b) - routine in children

### Chemoprophylaxis
For close contacts of meningococcal or Hib meningitis cases
