# Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 Adult Guidelines

## Overview

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021 guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of sepsis and septic shock in adult patients. These guidelines emphasize rapid recognition, immediate treatment, and post-ICU care.

**Key Updates from 2016:**
- Greater emphasis on post-ICU and post-discharge care
- Increased geographic and gender diversity in guideline development
- Updated Hour-1 Bundle recommendations
- New recommendations on corticosteroids, fluids, and vasopressors

## Definitions

### Sepsis (Sepsis-3)
- Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection
- **Clinical marker:** SOFA score ≥2 points from baseline

### Septic Shock
- Sepsis with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors AND
- Serum lactate >2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate fluid resuscitation

### Hour-1 Bundle
For patients with sepsis or septic shock, immediate intervention should include:
1. Measure lactate level (remeasure if elevated >2 mmol/L)
2. Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics
3. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics
4. Begin 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus for hypotension or lactate ≥4 mmol/L
5. Apply vasopressors if hypotensive during/after fluid resuscitation (target MAP ≥65 mmHg)

## Screening and Recognition

### Screening Recommendations

**For hospitals:** Implement performance improvement programs including:
- Sepsis screening for acutely ill, high-risk patients
- Standard operating procedures for treatment

**Screening tools:**
- **qSOFA:** NOT recommended as single screening tool (use with clinical judgment)
- **SIRS, NEWS, MEWS:** Acceptable alternatives
- **Blood lactate:** Suggested for adults suspected of sepsis

### Initial Assessment

**Immediate recognition:** Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies requiring:
- Rapid diagnosis
- Immediate intervention
- Time-sensitive treatment

## Initial Resuscitation

### Fluid Resuscitation

**Recommendation:** For sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock:
- Give at least **30 mL/kg IV crystalloid** within first 3 hours
- Use **dynamic measures** to guide (passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, PPV, echo)
- **Avoid relying solely** on physical exam or static parameters

**Fluid choice:**
- **Crystalloids** as first-line (strong recommendation)
- **Balanced crystalloids** (e.g., lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) preferred over normal saline (weak recommendation)
- **Albumin** suggested when large crystalloid volumes required (weak recommendation)
- **Avoid:** Starches (strong against), gelatin (weak against)

**Monitoring:**
- Guide resuscitation to decrease lactate in patients with elevated levels
- Capillary refill time can be used as adjunct (weak recommendation)

### Vasopressors

**First-line:** **Norepinephrine**
- Start peripherally if central access not immediately available
- Short-term use in antecubital or more proximal veins acceptable
- Switch to central access as soon as practical

**Target MAP:** **≥65 mmHg** (strong recommendation)

**Adding second agent:**
- **Vasopressin** suggested when norepinephrine inadequate (typical start: 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine dose)
- **Epinephrine** suggested when norepinephrine + vasopressin inadequate

**Avoid:** Terlipressin (weak recommendation against)

### Inotropes

For septic shock with cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume and BP:
- Suggest **dobutamine** added to norepinephrine OR **epinephrine** alone
- **Avoid:** Levosimendan (weak recommendation against)

## Antimicrobial Therapy

### Timing

**Strong recommendations:**
- **Septic shock or high likelihood sepsis:** Administer antibiotics **immediately, ideally within 1 hour**
- **Possible sepsis without shock:** Rapid assessment of infectious vs. non-infectious causes

**Weak recommendations:**
- **Sepsis without shock:** Time-limited investigation, antibiotics within 3 hours if infection persists
- **Low likelihood infection without shock:** Suggest deferring antibiotics while monitoring

### Selection

**Empiric broad-spectrum therapy:**
- Cover likely bacterial/fungal pathogens
- Consider local resistance patterns
- Account for immune status and risk factors

**MRSA coverage:**
- **High risk:** Empiric MRSA coverage recommended (vancomycin or linezolid)
- **Low risk:** Against routine MRSA coverage

**Gram-negative coverage:**
- **High MDR risk:** Two gram-negative agents suggested
- **Low MDR risk:** Against two gram-negative agents
- Once pathogen/sensitivities known: Against double gram-negative coverage

**Fungal coverage:**
- **High risk:** Empiric antifungal suggested
- **Low risk:** Against routine antifungals

**Antiviral:** No recommendation (insufficient evidence)

### Administration

**Pharmacokinetic optimization:**
- Use prolonged beta-lactam infusion after initial bolus (weak recommendation)
- Optimize dosing based on PK/PD principles and drug properties (best practice)

### Source Control

- Remove infected intravascular devices promptly after alternative access established
- Drain abscesses, debride infected tissue as soon as feasible
- Obtain appropriate cultures before antibiotics when possible (don't delay antibiotics for this)

### De-escalation and Duration

**Daily assessment:** Suggest daily evaluation for antibiotic de-escalation

**Duration:**
- **Shorter duration** preferred over longer when adequate source control (weak recommendation)
- **Procalcitonin + clinical evaluation:** Suggest using to guide discontinuation when duration unclear

## Hemodynamic Management

### Monitoring

**Invasive blood pressure monitoring:**
- Suggested for septic shock when practical and resources available

### Fluid Balance

**No recommendation:** Restrictive vs. liberal fluid strategies in first 24 hours after initial resuscitation
- **Principle:** Give fluids only if hypoperfusion present

## Ventilation (Sepsis-Induced Respiratory Failure)

### General Principles

**High-flow nasal oxygen:** Suggested over noninvasive ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure

**Noninvasive vs. invasive ventilation:** No recommendation (insufficient evidence)

### ARDS Management

**For sepsis-induced ARDS:**

**Strong recommendations:**
- **Low tidal volume:** 6 mL/kg predicted body weight (vs. >10 mL/kg)
- **Plateau pressure:** Upper limit goal 30 cm H2O (vs. higher pressures)

**Weak recommendations:**
- **Higher PEEP** over lower PEEP (moderate-severe ARDS)
- **Low tidal volume** even without ARDS
- **Traditional recruitment maneuvers** (moderate-severe ARDS)
- **Against:** Incremental PEEP titration strategy

**Strong recommendations:**
- **Prone ventilation** >12 hours daily (moderate-severe ARDS)

**Weak recommendations:**
- **Intermittent NMBA boluses** over continuous infusion (moderate-severe ARDS)
- **Veno-venous ECMO** when conventional ventilation fails (experienced centers only)

### Oxygen Targets

**No recommendation:** Conservative vs. liberal oxygen targets in sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure

## Additional Therapies

### Corticosteroids

**For septic shock with ongoing vasopressor requirement:**
- Suggest IV corticosteroids (weak recommendation)
- **Typical:** Hydrocortisone 200 mg/day (50 mg q6h or continuous infusion)
- Start when norepinephrine/epinephrine ≥0.25 mcg/kg/min for ≥4 hours

### Blood Purification

- **Against:** Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (weak recommendation)
- **No recommendation:** Other blood purification techniques

### Transfusion

**Restrictive strategy recommended** over liberal strategy
- Typical trigger: Hemoglobin <7 g/dL (70 g/L)
- **Consider clinical context:** Ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage

### Immunoglobulins

**Against:** IV immunoglobulin (weak recommendation)

### Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis

**Suggest:** In patients with risk factors for GI bleeding (weak recommendation)

### Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis

**Strong recommendations:**
- Pharmacologic prophylaxis unless contraindicated
- **LMWH preferred** over unfractionated heparin

**Weak recommendation against:** Mechanical prophylaxis in addition to pharmacologic

### Renal Replacement Therapy

- Suggest either **continuous OR intermittent** RRT in sepsis with AKI (weak recommendation)
- **Against:** RRT when no definitive indications and AKI without need

### Glucose Control

**Strong recommendation:** Initiate insulin at glucose ≥180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L)
- Typical target after initiation: 144-180 mg/dL (8-10 mmol/L)

### Vitamin C

**Against:** IV vitamin C (weak recommendation)

### Sodium Bicarbonate

**Against:** For hemodynamics or vasopressor reduction in hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia (weak)

**Suggest:** For severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤7.2) with AKIN score 2-3 (weak)

### Nutrition

**Suggest:** Early enteral nutrition (within 72 hours) for patients who can be fed enterally (weak)

## Long-Term Outcomes and Goals of Care

### Goals of Care Discussions

**Strong recommendations:**
- Discuss goals of care and prognosis with patients/families
- Integrate palliative care principles when appropriate

**Weak recommendations:**
- Address goals of care early (within 72 hours) vs. late
- **Against:** Routine formal palliative care consultation for all patients

### Discharge Planning

**Strong recommendations (best practice):**
- Involve patients/families in discharge planning
- Medication reconciliation at ICU and hospital discharge
- Include ICU stay summary in discharge documentation
- Discharge plans should include follow-up for new impairments

**Weak recommendations:**
- Use critical care transition program on transfer to ward
- Offer written/verbal sepsis education before discharge
- Refer survivors to peer support groups

### Post-Discharge Follow-up

**Strong recommendation (best practice):** 
- Assess and follow-up for physical, cognitive, and emotional problems after discharge

**Weak recommendations:**
- Refer to post-critical illness follow-up program if available
- Refer to rehabilitation program if mechanically ventilated >48h or ICU stay >72h

**No recommendation:** Early vs. routine post-discharge follow-up timing

**No recommendation:** For or against early cognitive therapy

## Special Populations and Considerations

### Pregnancy

- Physiologic changes affect sepsis recognition and treatment
- Consult obstetrics and critical care
- Modified resuscitation targets may be needed

### Resource-Limited Settings

Guidelines designed for high-resource settings; adaptation may be needed based on local context and availability.

## Quality Improvement

**Strong recommendation:** Hospitals should implement sepsis performance improvement programs including:
- Screening protocols
- Standard operating procedures
- Regular audit and feedback
- Multidisciplinary sepsis teams
