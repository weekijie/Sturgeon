# USPSTF Breast Cancer Screening Recommendation

## Recommendation Summary

| Population | Recommendation | Grade |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Women aged 40 to 74 years | The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. | B |
| Women 75 years or older | The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. | I |
| Women with dense breasts | The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. | I |

## Importance

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death among US women. In 2023, an estimated 43,170 women died of breast cancer.

**Key Statistics:**
- Non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence of breast cancer (136.3 cases per 100,000)
- Non-Hispanic Black women have the second highest incidence rate (128.3 cases per 100,000)
- Incidence gradually increased among women aged 40 to 49 years from 2015 to 2019 (2.0% average annual increase)

**Disparities:**
Black women are 40% more likely to die from breast cancer than White women. They are:
- More likely to be diagnosed beyond stage I
- More likely to have triple-negative cancers (ER-, PR-, HER2-)
- More likely to have aggressive tumors

## What's New

For the current recommendation, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged **40 to 49 years**, rather than individualizing the decision to undergo screening for women in this age group.

Previously, the USPSTF recommended that women in their 40s make an individual decision with their clinician on when to start screening.

## Implementation

### Screening Tests

**Mammography Modalities:**
- Digital mammography
- Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT, or "3D mammography")

Both modalities are effective for screening. DBT must be accompanied by traditional digital mammography or synthetic digital mammography.

### Screening Interval

- **Biennial screening** (every 2 years) is recommended
- Biennial screening has a more favorable trade-off of benefits vs harms than annual screening
- No significant difference in detection of cancers stage IIB or higher between annual vs biennial screening

### Who Should Be Screened

**This recommendation applies to:**
- Cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth
- Ages 40 years and older at average risk of breast cancer
- Persons with factors associated with increased risk (family history, dense breasts)

**This recommendation does NOT apply to:**
- Persons with genetic markers (BRCA1/BRCA2)
- History of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest at young age
- Previous breast cancer or high-risk breast lesion

## Benefits of Screening

**Modeling Data:**
Compared with no screening, biennial screening from ages 40 to 74 years:
- Estimated 286 to 337 life-years gained per 1000 women screened
- Estimated 42 to 61 cases of breast cancer averted per 1000 women
- Estimated 24 to 28 breast cancer deaths averted per 1000 women

**For Black Women:**
- Similar breast cancer mortality reduction
- Greater life-years gained compared with all women
- Estimated 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted per 1000 Black women screened

## Harms of Screening

**False-Positive Results:**
- Psychological harms (anxiety, distress)
- Additional testing and imaging
- Invasive follow-up procedures (biopsies)

**Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment:**
- Detection of lesions that would not have led to health problems
- DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) - noninvasive condition with uncertain prognostic significance
- Treatment of overdiagnosed lesions leads to unnecessary interventions

**Radiation Exposure:**
- Small increased risk of radiation-induced breast cancer
- Benefit of screening outweighs this risk

## Dense Breasts

Nearly half of all women have dense breasts, which:
- Increases risk for breast cancer
- Means mammograms may not work as well (reduced sensitivity)

**Current Evidence:**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening (ultrasound or MRI)
- Women with dense breasts should still be screened starting at age 40
- Talk to clinician about options for follow-up testing

## Pathway to Benefit

To achieve the benefit of screening and mitigate disparities in breast cancer mortality:
- All persons with abnormal screening results must receive equitable and appropriate follow-up
- All persons diagnosed with breast cancer must receive effective treatment
- Address barriers to follow-up and treatment in underserved populations

## Clinical Considerations

### Risk Assessment

Risk factors for breast cancer include:
- Age (most important risk factor)
- Family history of breast cancer
- Dense breast tissue
- Previous benign breast disease
- Reproductive factors (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity)
- Hormone therapy use
- Obesity (postmenopausal)
- Alcohol consumption

### Shared Decision-Making

For women aged 40-49:
- Now recommended to screen all women in this age group
- Previously, individualized decision-making was recommended

For women 75+:
- Evidence insufficient to recommend for or against
- Consider patient's overall health, life expectancy, prior screening history, and preferences

### Adjunctive Screening

For women with dense breasts and negative mammogram:
- No current recommendation for or against supplemental screening
- Insufficient evidence on benefits of ultrasound or MRI
- Research urgently needed
