# British Thoracic Society CAP Guidelines (2009, Updated 2015)

## Quick Reference Guide

### Initial Assessment

All patients with suspected CAP should have:
- Chest X-ray to confirm diagnosis
- Oxygen saturation assessment
- Routine blood tests (FBC, U&E, CRP)
- Risk stratification using CRB65 or CURB65

### CRB65 Score (Community Setting)

For patients managed in the community (no blood test required):

**1 point for each:**
- **C**onfusion (new onset)
- **R**espiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min
- **B**lood pressure: systolic <90 or diastolic ≤60 mmHg
- **65** years of age or older

**Risk stratification:**
- Score 0: Low risk (mortality <1%) - Home treatment
- Score 1-2: Intermediate risk (mortality 1-10%) - Consider hospital assessment
- Score 3-4: High risk (mortality >10%) - Urgent hospital admission

### CURB65 Score (Hospital Setting)

For patients in hospital (requires blood urea measurement):

**1 point for each:**
- **C**onfusion (AMT ≤8 or new disorientation)
- **U**rea >7 mmol/L (or BUN >20 mg/dL)
- **R**espiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min
- **B**lood pressure: systolic <90 or diastolic ≤60 mmHg
- **65** years of age or older

**Risk stratification:**
- Score 0-1: Low risk - Consider home treatment
- Score 2: Intermediate risk - Short hospital stay or very close outpatient supervision
- Score 3-5: High risk - Hospital admission, consider ICU if score 4-5

### Severity Assessment for ICU Admission

Consider ICU referral for patients with:
- CURB65 score 4-5
- Respiratory rate ≥30 despite treatment
- PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤250
- Multilobar consolidation
- Systolic BP <90 mmHg requiring fluid resuscitation
- Confusion/drowsiness

### Investigations

**All hospitalized patients:**
- Chest X-ray (within 4 hours if possible)
- O2 saturation and ABG if SaO2 <92% or severe pneumonia
- FBC, U&E, CRP, LFT
- Blood cultures (before antibiotics if possible)
- Sputum culture (if purulent sputum)

**Consider additional tests:**
- Pneumococcal urinary antigen
- Legionella urinary antigen (if severe, travel, institutional outbreak)
- Pleural fluid aspiration if effusion present
- Bronchoscopy if atypical pathogens suspected or non-resolving

### Empiric Antibiotic Therapy

#### Community Treatment (CRB65 0-1)

**First line:**
- Amoxicillin 500mg-1g three times daily for 5-7 days

**Penicillin allergy:**
- Doxycycline 200mg loading then 100mg daily
- OR Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily

**If atypical pathogens suspected:**
- Add clarithromycin 500mg twice daily
- OR use doxycycline alone

#### Hospital Treatment (Non-Severe, CURB65 2)

**First line:**
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 625mg three times daily
- OR Cefuroxime 750mg-1.5g three times daily

**Penicillin allergy:**
- Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily
- OR Doxycycline 200mg loading then 100mg daily

**If atypical pathogens suspected:**
- Add clarithromycin to above beta-lactam
- OR Levofloxacin 500mg twice daily alone

#### Severe Pneumonia (CURB65 3-5)

**First line:**
- Co-amoxiclav 1.2g three times daily IV PLUS Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily IV/oral
- OR Cefuroxime 1.5g three times daily IV PLUS Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily IV/oral

**Penicillin allergy:**
- Levofloxacin 500mg twice daily IV/oral

**If MRSA suspected (previous MRSA, recent hospitalization, skin colonization):**
- Add vancomycin OR linezolid

**If Pseudomonas suspected (bronchiectasis, steroids, recent broad-spectrum antibiotics):**
- Add piperacillin-tazobactam OR ceftazidime OR meropenem

### Legionella Treatment

When Legionella suspected (severe pneumonia, institutional outbreak, travel):

**Preferred:**
- Azithromycin 500mg once daily (continue until afebrile 3-5 days, minimum 10-14 days total)
- OR Levofloxacin 500mg twice daily

**Duration:** 10-14 days for mild, up to 21 days for severe

### Duration of Therapy

**Minimum recommended:**
- 5 days for uncomplicated CAP
- Longer if slow response or complications

**Criteria for switching to oral antibiotics:**
- Clinically stable (afebrile 24-48 hours, hemodynamically stable)
- Tolerating oral intake
- Oxygenation adequate on room air or home oxygen
- No contraindications to oral therapy

### Follow-up

- Review within 48 hours if treated at home
- Repeat chest X-ray at 6 weeks if:
  - Symptoms persist
  - Patient >50 years
  - History of smoking
  - Radiographic appearance suspicious for malignancy

### Special Populations

#### Aspiration Pneumonia

- No routine anaerobic cover needed unless lung abscess or empyema
- Standard CAP antibiotics usually adequate

#### Pregnancy

- Avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines
- Amoxicillin/ampicillin safe
- Macrolides generally safe (prefer azithromycin)

#### Immunocompromised

- Broader empiric coverage may be needed
- Early bronchoscopy with BAL for diagnosis
- Consider PCP prophylaxis/treatment if appropriate

## Key Differences from 2007 Guidelines

- Emphasis on severity assessment with CURB65
- Shorter antibiotic courses acceptable (5 days minimum)
- More restrictive approach to ICU admission
- Updated recommendations on atypical pathogen coverage
