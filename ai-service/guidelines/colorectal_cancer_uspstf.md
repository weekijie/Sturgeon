# USPSTF Colorectal Cancer Screening Recommendation

## Recommendation Summary

| Population | Recommendation | Grade |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Adults aged 50 to 75 years | The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. | A |
| Adults aged 45 to 49 years | The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. | B |
| Adults aged 76 to 85 years | The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. | C |

## Importance

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52,980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021.

**Key Statistics:**
- Most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years
- 10.5% of new cases occur in persons younger than 50 years
- Incidence in adults aged 40-49 has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2016
- In 2016, 25.6% of eligible adults had never been screened
- In 2018, 31.2% were not up to date with screening

## What's New

The USPSTF **expanded the recommended ages** for colorectal cancer screening to 45 to 75 years (previously 50 to 75 years). The USPSTF continues to recommend selectively screening adults aged 76 to 85 years.

## Who Should Be Screened

**This recommendation applies to:**
- Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older
- At average risk for colorectal cancer

**Average risk means:**
- No prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease
- No personal diagnosis or family history of genetic disorders (Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis)

## Screening Strategies

### Stool-Based Tests

| Test | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| High-sensitivity gFOBT | Every year | Chemical detection of blood |
| Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) | Every year | Antibody detection of blood; no dietary restrictions |
| Stool DNA-FIT (sDNA-FIT) | Every 1 to 3 years | Detects DNA biomarkers and blood |

**Key Points:**
- Positive results require follow-up colonoscopy
- FIT preferred over gFOBT (easier to use, no dietary restrictions)
- Annual FIT provides greater life-years gained than sDNA-FIT every 3 years

### Direct Visualization Tests

| Test | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Colonoscopy | Every 10 years | Gold standard; visualizes entire colon |
| CT colonography | Every 5 years | May reveal extracolonic findings |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Every 5 years | Visualizes only distal colon |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy + annual FIT | Every 10 years + annually | Combined approach |

**Key Points:**
- All direct visualization tests require bowel preparation
- Colonoscopy typically requires sedation/anesthesia
- Abnormal findings on CT colonography or sigmoidoscopy require follow-up colonoscopy

## Screening Intervals

**Recommended Intervals:**
- High-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT: **every year**
- sDNA-FIT: **every 1 to 3 years**
- CT colonography: **every 5 years**
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy: **every 5 years**
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy + FIT: **every 10 years + annually**
- Colonoscopy: **every 10 years**

## Benefits of Screening

**Modeling Data (screening from ages 45 to 75):**
- 286 to 337 life-years gained per 1000 adults screened
- 42 to 61 cases of colorectal cancer averted per 1000 adults
- 24 to 28 colorectal cancer deaths averted per 1000 adults

**Lowering starting age from 50 to 45:**
- Additional 2 to 3 cases averted per 1000 adults
- Additional 1 death averted per 1000 adults
- Additional 22 to 27 life-years gained per 1000 adults

## Harms of Screening

### Colonoscopy

**Serious Harms:**
- Major bleeding: 14.6 events per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 9.4-19.9)
- Perforation: 3.1 events per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 2.3-4.0)
- Cardiopulmonary events (rare, related to sedation)

**Risk Factors:**
- Increasing risk of bleeding and perforation with increasing age
- Higher risk in therapeutic vs screening colonoscopy

### Flexible Sigmoidoscopy

- Major bleeding: 0.5 events per 10,000 sigmoidoscopies
- Perforation: 0.2 events per 10,000 sigmoidoscopies

### Other Harms

- False-positive results leading to unnecessary colonoscopy
- Anxiety and psychological distress
- Bowel preparation complications (dehydration, electrolyte imbalances)

## Special Populations

### Black Adults

**Disparities:**
- Highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer
- Incidence: 43.6 cases per 100,000 (vs 37.8 for White adults)
- Mortality: 18.0 deaths per 100,000 (vs 13.6 for White adults)

**Recommendations:**
- Same screening recommendations as general population (start at age 45)
- Strongly encourage ensuring Black patients receive screening, follow-up, and treatment
- Address disparities in access to care

## Disparities in Screening

**Current Practice:**
- 25.6% of eligible adults have never been screened
- Lower screening rates among Black and Hispanic adults

**Barriers:**
- Access to healthcare
- Cost and insurance coverage
- Knowledge and awareness
- Cultural and language barriers

## Implementation Considerations

### Stool-Based Tests

**Advantages:**
- Non-invasive
- Can be done at home
- No bowel preparation
- No sedation

**Disadvantages:**
- Require repeated testing over time
- Positive results require colonoscopy
- Lower sensitivity for detecting cancer compared to colonoscopy

### Direct Visualization Tests

**Advantages:**
- Longer intervals between screenings
- Higher sensitivity
- Ability to remove polyps during procedure (colonoscopy)

**Disadvantages:**
- Require bowel preparation
- Require clinical setting
- Sedation/anesthesia needed for colonoscopy
- Higher risk of complications

## Treatment

**Localized Cancer:**
- Surgical resection is primary treatment
- Additional treatments may include:
  - Adjuvant chemotherapy
  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  - Chemoradiation
  - Targeted therapies

**Depends on:**
- Cancer location and stage
- Tumor characteristics
- Patient factors
