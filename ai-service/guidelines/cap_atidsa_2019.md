# ATS/IDSA Community-Acquired Pneumonia Guidelines (2019)

## Executive Summary

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary panel using GRADE methodology.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnostic Testing

**Recommendation 1:** For adults with CAP, we suggest obtaining a chest radiograph or other imaging when there is clinical suspicion for pneumonia to establish the diagnosis and identify complications.

**Recommendation 2:** For adults with CAP in whom a causative pathogen is being sought, we recommend collecting respiratory specimens prior to antibiotic initiation whenever possible.

**Recommendation 3:** For adults with CAP managed in the hospital, we recommend collecting blood cultures and sputum for culture in those with severe disease or risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas.

### Site of Care Decision

**Recommendation 4:** For adults with CAP, we recommend using validated clinical prediction rules for prognosis (such as the pneumonia severity index [PSI] or CURB-65) in conjunction with clinical judgment to determine the site of care.

**Recommendation 5:** For adults with CAP, we suggest against using procalcitonin alone to determine the need for initial antibiotic therapy.

### Empiric Antibiotic Therapy

**Recommendation 6:** For outpatient adults with CAP without comorbidities or risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, we recommend amoxicillin or doxycycline or a macrolide (if local pneumococcal resistance <25%).

**Recommendation 7:** For outpatient adults with CAP and comorbidities (chronic heart/lung/liver/renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy), we recommend either:
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate OR cephalosporin (cefuroxime, cefpodoxime) PLUS a macrolide OR doxycycline
- OR a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) alone

**Recommendation 8:** For adults with CAP managed in the hospital who do not require intensive care and have no risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, we recommend a beta-lactam (ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) plus a macrolide OR a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone.

**Recommendation 9:** For adults with CAP requiring intensive care admission, we recommend a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide OR a fluoroquinolone.

**Recommendation 10:** For adults with CAP and concern for MRSA infection, we recommend adding vancomycin OR linezolid to standard empiric therapy.

**Recommendation 11:** For adults with CAP and concern for Pseudomonas infection, we recommend adding an antipseudomonal agent (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem) to standard empiric therapy.

### Follow-up and Duration of Therapy

**Recommendation 12:** For adults with CAP, we recommend a minimum of 5 days of antibiotic therapy and that therapy should continue until the patient is clinically stable (afebrile for 48-72 hours, hemodynamically stable, improving oxygenation, able to take oral medications).

**Recommendation 13:** For adults with CAP who are not responding to initial empiric therapy within 72 hours, we recommend further diagnostic evaluation including consideration of noninfectious etiologies, resistant organisms, or complications (empyema, abscess).

## Risk Stratification Tools

### Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)

The PSI uses 20 variables to stratify patients into 5 risk classes (I-V). It is particularly useful for identifying low-risk patients who may be candidates for outpatient therapy.

Key factors:
- Demographics (age, sex, nursing home residence)
- Comorbidities (neoplastic disease, liver disease, CHF, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease)
- Physical exam (altered mental status, RR≥30, SBP<90, Temp<35°C or ≥40°C, pulse≥125)
- Laboratory (pH<7.35, BUN≥30, Na<130, glucose≥250, hematocrit<30%, PaO2<60, pleural effusion)

### CURB-65 Score

Simpler tool using 5 variables (1 point each):
- Confusion
- Urea >7 mmol/L (20 mg/dL)
- Respiratory rate ≥30/min
- Blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic or ≤60 mmHg diastolic
- Age ≥65 years

**Interpretation:**
- 0-1: Low risk, consider outpatient
- 2: Intermediate risk, consider hospitalization
- 3-5: High risk, hospitalization recommended

## Special Considerations

### Legionella Pneumonia

Legionella should be considered in:
- Severe pneumonia requiring ICU admission
- Outpatient antibiotic failure
- Recent travel (hotels, cruise ships)
- Immunocompromised patients
- Healthcare-associated pneumonia

**Diagnosis:** Urinary antigen test (detects L. pneumophila serogroup 1) plus culture or PCR of respiratory specimens.

**Treatment:** Macrolide (azithromycin) OR respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin). Fluoroquinolones may be preferred for severe disease.

### Aspiration Pneumonia

No specific recommendations for anaerobic coverage in aspiration pneumonia unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected. Standard CAP regimens usually adequate.

### Viral Pneumonia

Consider influenza and other viral pathogens, especially during seasonal outbreaks. Antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) should be started within 48 hours of symptom onset for influenza.
