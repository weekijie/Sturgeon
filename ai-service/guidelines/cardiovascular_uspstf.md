# USPSTF Statin Use for CVD Prevention Recommendation

## Recommendation Summary

| Population | Recommendation | Grade |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1+ CVD risk factors and 10-year CVD risk ≥10% | The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD. | B |
| Adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1+ CVD risk factors and 10-year CVD risk 7.5% to <10% | The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin. The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group. | C |
| Adults 76 years or older | The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin. | I |

## Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US, resulting in more than 1 of every 4 deaths.

**Key Statistics:**
- Coronary heart disease accounts for 43% of CVD deaths
- 2019: ~558,000 deaths from coronary heart disease
- 2019: ~109,000 deaths from ischemic stroke

**Demographic Differences:**
- Men have higher overall prevalence and mortality from CVD
- Women experience higher mortality from certain events (stroke)
- Men experience CVD events earlier in life
- Black adults have the highest prevalence of CVD (both sexes)

## Who Should Receive Statins

**This recommendation applies to:**
- Adults 40 years or older
- No history of known CVD
- No signs or symptoms of CVD

**This recommendation does NOT apply to:**
- Adults with LDL-C >190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L)
- Known familial hypercholesterolemia
- These populations are at very high risk; see other guidelines

## CVD Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors

The presence of **1 or more** of the following risk factors qualifies:
- **Dyslipidemia**
- **Diabetes**
- **Hypertension**
- **Smoking**

### 10-Year CVD Risk Estimation

**Recommended Tool:**
- ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations

**Tool Components:**
- Separate equations by sex
- Separate equations for Black vs non-Black persons
- Input: age, cholesterol levels, systolic BP, antihypertension treatment, diabetes, smoking status
- Output: 10-year risk of hard CVD events (MI, coronary death, ischemic stroke, stroke death)

**Key Insight:**
- Age is one of the strongest risk factors
- 10-year CVD risk is heavily influenced by increasing age
- Risk prediction generally shows higher risk for Black persons

### Risk Categories and Recommendations

| 10-Year CVD Risk | Recommendation | Strength |
|------------------|----------------|----------|
| ≥10% | Initiate moderate-intensity statin | Grade B |
| 7.5% to <10% | Selectively offer statin | Grade C |
| <7.5% | No recommendation for statin therapy | N/A |

## Statin Intensity

### ACC/AHA Definitions

| Intensity | LDL-C Reduction | Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| High-intensity | ≥50% | Atorvastatin 40-80 mg, Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg |
| Moderate-intensity | 30% to <50% | Atorvastatin 10-20 mg, Rosuvastatin 5-10 mg, Simvastatin 20-40 mg, Pravastatin 40-80 mg |
| Low-intensity | <30% | Simvastatin 10 mg, Pravastatin 10-20 mg |

**Recommendation:**
- Most trials used moderate-intensity statin therapy
- Moderate-intensity is reasonable for primary prevention in most persons

## Benefits of Statin Therapy

### Pooled Trial Results (22 trials, mean follow-up 3.3 years)

| Outcome | Relative Risk Reduction | Absolute Risk Difference |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| All-cause mortality | 8% (RR 0.92) | -0.35% |
| Fatal or nonfatal stroke | 22% (RR 0.78) | -0.39% |
| Fatal or nonfatal MI | 33% (RR 0.67) | -0.89% |
| Composite CVD outcomes | 28% (RR 0.72) | -1.28% |

### Subgroup Findings
- Benefits do not appear to differ by:
  - Age (though limited data for >75 years)
  - Sex
  - Race/ethnicity
  - Presence of specific risk factors (hypertension, diabetes)

### Evidence in Older Adults

**PROSPER Trial (ages 70-82, mean age 75):**
- No decrease in all-cause mortality
- No decrease in stroke risk
- No decrease in composite CVD outcomes

**ALLHAT-LLT (age ≥75 subgroup):**
- Higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with statin vs usual care
- Estimates imprecise; not statistically significant

**Conclusion:** Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against statin initiation in adults 76+

## Harms of Statin Therapy

### Based on Trial Data

**No Increased Risk:**
- Myalgia (muscle pain)
- Elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase)
- Cancer incidence
- Renal harms
- Cognitive harms

**Possible/Conflicting Evidence:**
- **Diabetes:** Most trials found no association; JUPITER trial found increased risk with high-intensity statin (limited to participants with diabetes risk factors)
- **Cataract:** One trial found increased risk of cataract surgery (RR 1.24)

### Observational Data

- Some studies report association between statin use and muscle pain
- Risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is very low

## Implementation

### Step 1: Identify Candidates
- Age 40-75 years
- No known CVD
- 1+ risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking)

### Step 2: Estimate CVD Risk
- Use ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations
- Calculate 10-year CVD risk

### Step 3: Discuss with Patient
- For 10-year risk ≥10%: recommend statin initiation
- For 10-year risk 7.5%-<10%: selectively offer; discuss smaller benefit
- Consider patient values and preferences

### Step 4: Prescribe
- Moderate-intensity statin is reasonable for most
- No target LDL-C level required (fixed-dose approach)

## Disparities in Statin Use

**Current Practice Gaps:**
- Black adults: decreased likelihood of statin prescription vs White adults
- Hispanic adults: lowest statin utilization rates
- Uninsured: decreased likelihood of statin use
- Multiple vulnerabilities: older age, female, Black, area poverty, no insurance

**Recommendation:**
- Equitably improve statin use in all demographics
- Focus on Black and Hispanic adults (highest CVD prevalence, lowest statin use)

## Adults 76+ Years

**Evidence Gap:**
- Limited trial data for this age group
- Available evidence suggests no benefit or possible harm

**Practice Consideration:**
- This recommendation is about **initiating** statins
- Does not address continuing statins in patients already taking them
